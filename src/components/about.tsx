        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am GÃ¡bor Szendrei, currently studying Software Information Technology BSC at the University of Miskolc and i'm an intern at Hungarian National Tax and Customs Administration.</p>

        <p>My interest in programming dates back to my early teenage years, I was already operating and configuring Minecraft servers. Since then, my passion has only grown, and become more serious. Currently, the Python language that has captured my heart, I enjoy every moment of development with it, regardless of the project. Another area of interest for me involves web development and operations.</p>

        <p>For me, personal development is very important. In my free time, I dedicate a lot of time to self-improvement and practice.</p>
